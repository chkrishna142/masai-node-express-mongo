# Auth & OAuth

Board Link: https://excalidraw.com/#json=43_hu-dirMXxIrB-LHM02,v21yDb0aXGVY4ZKnxz51WA

We have no mechanism to tie each request with the user.


```

Without Auth


POST /abcde/post

{
    title: "Some offensive post",
}


POST /post
HEADER
 - auth-token: <some-token> // identification for that user, generated by backend

{
    title: "Some offensive post",

}
```
